This project folder includes projects that I have done in grit:lab 2024-2026

## Golang

### go-reload

First project I have ever coded! The project is simple low level code to learn how loops, switch cases and different variables work by reading the files from input line, modifying the content strings and then saving to a new output file.

### groupie-tracker

An early web application project that consumes RESTful APIs to display artist and concert information. I learned a lot about JSON parsing, data linking, and error handling.

### lem-in

A Go project simulating an ant farm that thought me the use of algorithms. The program reads a file describing ants, rooms, and tunnels, then finds the quickest way to move all ants from the start room to the end room.

## JavaScript

### sortable

First javaScript project done during the first week of learning JS, done together with two colleagues. We needed to fetch RestAPI data about superheroes and clean, organize and present it so that the user can filter different attributes.

### make-your-game

My first ever game: a single-player Pac-Man game built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I learned smooth rendering for 60 FPS movement and algorithm usage for ghost AI.

### social-network

This project started as a go-project for a simple forum and have been transforming since. First we had to add websockets for real time chat and in our JS-module it became our first time using frameworks (Next.js). As our last JS module project we (project group of 6 people) developed it even further into a facebook-like social platform with follow/unfollow functionality, groups (including events and group chats) and emoji support.

### bomberman-dom

My second ever game, a real-time multiplayer Bomberman-style game with Twilight theme. Game was built using vanilla JavaScript and a Node.js Websocket. I got to test through golang module acquired Websocket skills in JS environment and have fun with the team building this game.

## Java

**Coming soon**
