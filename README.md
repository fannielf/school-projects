# school projects
This project folder includes projects that I have done in grit:lab 2024-2026

## Golang

### go-reload

First project I have ever coded! The project is simple low level code to learn how loops, switch cases and different variables work by reading the files from input line, modifying the content strings and then saving to a new output file.

### groupie-tracker

### lem-in

## JavaScript

### sortable

First javaScript project done during the first week of learning JS, done together with two colleagues. We needed to fetch RestAPI data about superheroes and clean, organize and present it so that the user can filter different attributes.

### make-your-game

### social-network

This project started as a go-project for a simple forum and have been transforming since. First we had to add websockets for real time chat and in our JS-module it became our first time using frameworks (Next.js). As our last JS module project we (project group of 6 people) developed it even further into a facebook-like social platform with follow/unfollow functionality, groups (including events and group chats) and emoji support.

### bomberman-dom

## Java

### buy-01

Our whole Java module is based on this first project, so we needed to make it scalable. First phase includes implementing backend with microservices, discovery, gateway and kafka. The project runs from Docker.
